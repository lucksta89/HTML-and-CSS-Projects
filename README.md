also during the course i took more time to create my own web site which i have spent many many hours on,
also using bootstrap on some pages and using css inline and external, with the use of lotts of pictures, forms, tables, and much more,

i was lukcy to be able to apply my skills i learnt in the course so far and apply it to my own poroject which is allot of fun!

HOPE YOU ENJOY!
